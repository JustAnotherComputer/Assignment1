<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<p>Information Technology, or IT, has been called “the future” for a while now. Originally, I had no real interest in IT beyond playing video games and using the computer to browse the internet and read stories or watch something. However, when I started studying accounting, a family member remarked that ‘IT was the future, and one day, even the person who does accounting will be in fact, an IT specialist’. I didn’t exactly agree with this sentiment, of course. However, after giving it some thought I came to the conclusion that IT was prevalent in all fields, and this included accounting. In fact, IT is extremely useful in accounting as it reduces the margin of error and reduces tedious and time-consuming tasks. Time, which is precious resource in this day and age, can be saved by integrating IT into accounting. In addition to this, I realised that I had never really explored what IT truly was, and so I decided to learn what IT was all about.</p>
<p>I enrolled with OUA as part of an accounting degree, then picked Introduction to Information Technology as an elective. For that reason, I enrolled in RMIT.</p>
<p>My expectations of this course are fairly open. I expect to gain knowledge about the various fields IT engages in, hopefully finding something that piques my interest enough to study further. I am somewhat interested in programming, which I am studying as my second subject in this study period. However, I think gaining a broad introduction to IT as a whole will be extremely useful in selecting what field would further my goals and interests.

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p>This job combines the aspects of an IT specialist and an Accounting degree. You are working as an IT Trainer, similar to a teacher, and it would be extremely beneficial if you were to experience in finance and accounts and their processes. The job requires you to give training via webinars and create user guides. Not only does this job highly regard knowledge of finance and accounting, it involves teaching, which I am rather fond of. It also offers an opportunity to broaden skills in both fields, and it is known that teaching others helps you to improve further yourself.</p>
<p>For this job, IT training skills are required. So not only must you have skills in IT, you also need experience in training and making user guides. The other thing to note is that it doesn’t specify what type of field required in IT; however, one can infer it is the kind of technical expertise needed in business and accounts and finance management. Naturally, knowledge of accounting and finance would be highly valued as well, as it would be easier to understand the specific type of IT skills they require instruction in.</p>
<h3>My Current Skills</h3>
<p>As I am currently in the first year of my degree, I possess no real skills that I can write down on my resume. However, my degree consists of both, accounting and IT as an elective, so it is only a matter of building on the bases studying the degree will provide.</p>
<h3>My Plan</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to finish the degree itself. At the same time, studying all the relevant IT fields which help in business management, finance and accounting will be needed. After studying the relevant courses, teaching experience will be required. For this, one can look towards TAFE, as they allow you to practically volunteer in a job-related course, to gain practical experience, as well as create free user guides for various things online. Practical experience will aid immensely with acquiring the skills needed for this job.</p>
