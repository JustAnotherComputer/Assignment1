<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>Name: Romaisa Ahsen</p>
<p>Student Number: s3866049</p>
<p>Email: s3866049@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>Background: I am from Pakistan, from the province of Punjab. I completed my A-levels (Year 12 equivalent) at the age of 19. A few years later I got married and migrated to Australia. I can fluently speak English, as well as my mother tongue Urdu. I have recently decided to study online and pursue my interests. I enjoy studying and learning new things – and I can appreciate studying more now, since I am not being ‘forced’ to study for the sake of getting good grades and such.</p>

<p>My results of the Myers Brigg test showed I was a mediator. This coincided with my team roles test result, which showed I was a good communicator. In other words, the test results all coincide with each other. I always learned better when someone explained things to me; as a result, I learn more from lectures and explanations than I do from reading. I’m not averse to reading itself though – in fact, I actually enjoy reading.</p>

<p>A team has many different roles within it. One role which I don’t enjoy, nor aspire to get, is the role of Team Leader. I prefer carrying out my instructions to the best of my ability; more of a ‘following instructions’ type than a ‘leader’ person. However, I don’t shy away from discussing things. If there is one thing that I have learned over the years, it is that proper communication prevents misunderstandings. Good communication makes a team perform properly.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few things to note. I don’t particularly enjoy large gatherings or unnecessary talking; however, I don’t shy away from talking in a group either. In any team, I prefer to be the supportive team member who does their task to the very best of their ability and resolve to keep conflicts to a minimum. If there are new things to learn, I prefer having them explained to me first, before I try them out on my own. I like things being organised and manageable; small to-do lists make the larger task seem less daunting and easier. As a result, I’m always making lists and breaking down tasks into smaller bits. Of course, I don’t actually enjoy imposing my way of working on other people. Everyone has their own way of doing things, and respecting that is also part of what makes a team. However, I also dislike it when team members don’t talk to each other. Open communication and honesty when meeting deadlines are very important in a task. It’s important to keep everyone up to date on how far you’ve come along – and in some cases it may even provide adequate motivation for people to meet their deadlines.</p>
<p>The results of my quizzes all point to these aspects of my personality. Of course, I should add that adapting to new environments is also an essential skill, and one’s role in a team may change accordingly.</p>
