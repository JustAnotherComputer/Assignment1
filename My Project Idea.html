<h1>My Project Idea</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The idea is to make a fantasy game in which you play as a historian rather than the “hero” of a nation. Essentially, your main character is a historian dedicated to preserving the ‘true history’, free from ‘history is written by the winners’ and keep the history preserved as records. Of course, this means that instead of relying on word of mouth, they have to observe events themselves, and this means exploring first-hand where the events took place. As a historian, you will travel the world, observing, exploring and documenting what you find.</p>
<p style="border: 2px solid darkblue;
  padding: 8px;">“Do you not wish to know the secrets the world holds? What happened within these lands, the stories that you will not find in the pages of any history book or fairy tale? How did the world come to be the way it is?”</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>So, there are lots of games where you play as a hero. And as the hero who shapes the events of history, you see things that probably won’t end up in any history book, because they’re too obscure. Or maybe history omits it because it is inconvenient for the nation. I want a game where instead of playing as this hero, you play as a historian, but not a historian of any particular nation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Premise</h3>
<p>The premise of the game is that you work in a small organisation, whose main purpose is to document the events that shape history. Every event, no matter how small or insignificant, is documented, so that the effects can be properly observed.</p>
<h3>The Historians</h3>
<p>A small organisation, which has no real name and no publicity. Their base is a tiny village referred to as ‘the library’ and they call themselves historians. Their sole aim is to preserve history in its truest form.</p>
<h4>Recruiting</h4>
<p>There is no publicity for this group as publicity would draw unwanted attention. Instead, the original founder took some time to lay down rules and establish some practices to preserve the integrity and life of the organisation. Most of their members comprise of orphans who have nowhere else to call home; they are recruited and trained from a very young age. However, rarely, the organisation accepts people who know of them to enlist; most of them are met with a measure of distrust initially until they otherwise prove that their intentions are just.</p>
<h4>Current Base</h4>
<p>The base of the organisation is a small nomad village; they use magic to conceal their entrance – and are mostly nomadic. They refer to their village as the library. Their knowledge is stored in four different ways: in written form (books and such), on memory crystals (stones that can store information), passed down orally from generation to generation, and finally (and this is perhaps the most relevant to the present era), a portion is cross checked with the history books and knowledge of the current era (the ones that the library historians do not maintain). Regarding this it should be noted there are people aware of the existence of the historians of the library; however, what they choose to do with this knowledge has been different in every era.</p>
<h4>Timeframe</h4>
<p>It should be noted that, if we compare the life of a nation to the life of a person, we’ll find nations have much longer lifespans than people. As such the game will take place in two different eras (and yes, we’ll have different protagonists in each era). One will be relatively peaceful; the other will take place in turbulent times. So naturally, the members of the library will change as time moves on.</p>
<h4>Aim</h4>
<p>Why should an organisation document true history? Especially when no one will read it? Why should they not? There is no reason for the truth to get buried because of politics and there are ways to make sure voices are heard and preserved. If one looks at history, you’ll see the same mistakes being repeated over and over. We may not learn from the mistakes of the past, but it’s still important to know what happened, perhaps one day someone will learn and avert tragedy.</p>
<p>Also, it is known that, on occasion, the members of the library do intervene in certain events. This may not make them as unbiased as they claim to be, but that debate can be held in-game.</p>
<h3>Races</h3>
<p>There are a number of races that live in this world.</p>
<p>Water based races: Comprising of mermen, mermaids, and were-creatures, majority of these dwell underwater, or near bodies of water. While they are known to occasionally wander on land, straying too far from water for too long can prove disastrous to their wellbeing.</p>
<p>Fire based races: Comprising of giant clans and drakes. They dwell in areas such as volcanoes and deserts.</p>
<p>Earth based races: Comprising of gnomes, and a vast majority of land dwelling races including humans and other were-creatures. Some of these races dwell below ground, and some of them make their homes above the land.</p>
<p>Wind based races: Comprising of sylphs and birdmen clans, most of these races prefer to dwell on top of mountains, in forests, and along coastlines and such.</p>
<p>Other than them, there are a number of were-creatures who live in the world, attuned to various elements.</p>
<h3>Nations</h3>
<p>There are many tiny clans and nations that dot the landscape (or sea scape) of the world, but among these, the three major nations are:</p>
<p>Rubelite: A nation comprising mainly of giants, gnomes and humans. A large nation famous for combining the forging expertise of gnomes, giants and humans; they propelled their nation to greater heights of prosperity through advancements in technology. However, as it is combined of three different races, racism is an ever present issue.</p>
<p>Ascillia: An underwater nation comprising of the many underwater races that live in the ocean.</p>
<p>Veldonya Woods: A large forest nation, comprising of several smaller nations that act together as an alliance. Comprising of mainly wind based races and earth based races. As an alliance, unity is always a problem.</p>
<h3>Cast</h3>
<p>All of the protagonists are members of the library village of historians.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Protagonists of the ‘peaceful era’:</p>
<p>Seth: A merman with a quiet disposition. He gets along with almost everyone, as he doesn’t talk much and listens to everyone; however, he has a tendency to bluntly call out people on their mistakes when he does talk. His primary area of work is in areas with a large amount of water.</p>
<p>Myrdin and Lucille: Myrdin is a talkative gnome, interested in ore and history in equal measure. He spends his idle time crafting all manner of things, aided by his feline friend, Lucille. Lucille is an old were-tiger; she spends most of her time training new initiates, and in her spare time, helps Myrdin with his tasks.</p>
<p>Ayame: A rather impulsive sylph, Ayame is a young ‘in-training’ historian. While she often tries to be calm and collected, as taught by her elders, often her impulsive and curious nature takes over and she tends to mess things up. She is carrying out her training in Vendonya Woods, although she is trying to get herself assigned to other, ‘more exciting’ areas, according to her.</p>
<p>Aven Armentile: A son of a somewhat prominent human family from Rubelite. Unlike most of the other historians, who are orphans raised by the historians themselves, Aven sought them out after learning about them through some of his contacts. He’s a skilled negotiator who has a way with words… unfortunately, he is somewhat mistrusted by the other historians and as of yet, they have not even disclosed the current location of their camp to him. While that may change as he completes more tasks for them; currently most historians avoid him.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Protagonists of the turbulent era:</p>
<p>Lucian: A quiet, yet rather mean spirited young human man. He was orphaned after a battle laid waste to his town, after which he was saved by a historian documenting the events. Several years of watching and documenting nothing but battles has left him a little sour, and he has little good things to say, if he does say anything.</p>
<p>Kazack of the Blue Flames: A drake from the clan of the Blue Flames. After watching repeated distortions of the truth from his own clan, he set out on his own to spread the word of the ‘truth’. This earned him the ire of his clan, but also drew the attention of the library, who requested he be appointed as a historian. Kazack is a diligent and principled person, and harbors some doubts as to whether he really belongs in the library. However, he has nowhere else to go, and is presently learning how to do his new job.</p>

<p>There are other characters as well, listing them all will take too long.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>At the start of the game, you will be presented with three different modes. The first two modes have a fixed set of characters and a plot the game follows. The first one is of the peaceful era, and the second one is the turbulent era. The last mode is a free form mode that isn’t confined to a single era. You may do anything you please in that era, however, there is no plot whatsoever, and you will be naming your characters yourself.</p>
<h3>Modes 1 & 2: The Two Eras</h3>
<p>In these modes you pick a main character to play as. You’ll play through their side of the story, the history that they document and world they experience.</p>
<p>However, no one said gathering history from around the world was safe. So, each character will have a set of primary skills that they can cultivate as they see fit, to defend themselves and carry out their duties. They will also have a set of secondary skills that improve life at their village, such as cooking, housekeeping, smithing, tailoring, alchemy, etc. Advancing skills can unlock more skill types and bonuses.</p>
<p>To gather history, historians do various things. They collect information by talking to people, observe the locations, harvest memory crystals from the environment, listen to the voices of the world around them.</p>
<p>All history gathered is noted down in a logbook that the player can access at any time. It also comes with a handy timeline diagram that will allow the player to see how each event influenced other events and what happened first and so on.</p>
<p>The world has a party of heroes! You just don’t play as them. In fact, you note down their accomplishments and deeds, but of course, this isn’t just their story, this is the world’s story.</p>
<p>The battle system isn’t very complex; and battling isn’t the main focus of the game anyway. The game will have overworld enemies, and a vast majority of them will not be hostile. It’ll be somewhat similar to a real time overworld battle system, although you’ll be able to pause in battle. Certain areas will be hostile and there will be a concentration of hostile enemies, but there will be ways to get around those. There will also be ways to level up without fighting. Well, you can beat the game without fighting, but perhaps the experience will be different if you do fight.</p>
<h3>Free Mode</h3>
<p>The free mode is somewhat wider in scope. The player gets to pick their characters and their races (which determine some innate skills) and can choose to explore anywhere they choose. They can explore how the world changes and explore the locations they didn’t during the story. Or they can play it in a certain way, such as document an entire nation’s history from start to finish.</p>
<p>The point of free mode is to literally explore the world’s story, freely and at your own pace, without being bothered by anything.</p>
<h2>Skills, Tools and Resources Needed</h2>
<p>We can use a game engine like unity to make the game, although if there are better alternatives available, we can use those. We’ll need skills in designing character portraits and sprites, as well as designing environments. We’ll also need to do world building and write down the history of the world; most of the game’s script will be just that. We’ll need skills in programming, character and environment design, and world building. These are pretty common skills in the world of video game making, it wouldn’t be hard to find them. World building is easy enough that I can do a large part of it myself.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>I just want to play a fun game where world changing events are happening, but I don’t want to be the one doing them. Someone else be the hero, I want to document stuff, write down history, just see the world’s story from a different set of eyes than the heroes.</p>
